Library Management System in JAVA - Prototype and documentation made for Software Engineer Class

Name: Fernanda Frederico Ribeiro da Silva
Class: CEN-3024C-16046
Professor: Walauskis

I had to develop a simple business solution documentation in PDF, following the SDLC, by:

Gathering software requirements.
Defining software requirements.
Creating an implementation plan for writing software.
Creating a testing plan to evaluate the software.
Deploying software.

------The documentation will be added to the project repository later on and linked here ----

And then creating a simple JAVA program prototype that implements this documentation to create the LMS

Library Management System (LMS) is a console-based application for managing a library's collection of books.
The LMS allows users to add new books to the collection from a text file, remove a book from the collection using its ID number,
and list all books currently in the collection.
The text file used to add new books should be formatted as follows: each line represents a book, and the id, title, and author are separated by a comma.
