Library Management System in JAVA - Prototype and documentation made for Software Engineer Class

Name: Fernanda Silva
Class: CEN-3024C-16046
Professor: Walauskis

I had to develop a simple business solution documentation in PDF, following the SDLC, by:

Gathering software requirements.
Defining software requirements.
Creating an implementation plan for writing software.
Creating a testing plan to evaluate the software.
Deploying software.

------The documentation will be added to the project repository later on and linked here ----


And then creating a simple JAVA program prototype that implements this documentation to create the LMS

Library Management System (LMS) is a console-based application for managing a library's collection of books.
The LMS allows users to add new books to the collection from a text file, remove a book from the collection using its ID number, 
Barcode Number or Book Title, list all books currently in the collection, reorder the ID's from the txt file to always be in order and remove gaps in numeration,
Check In and Out books with 4 weeks dueDate and alerts of already checked books or fine for late books checked in.

Started with simple database using a .txt file and a backup .txt file for the books list.
Last version is working with mySQL database for the book list.

GUI designed by me :D!
